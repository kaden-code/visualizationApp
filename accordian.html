            <div class="question">Perception Poem </div>
            <div class="answer">I look around see no reason to have an afliction. But my thoughts lead me to a demented dimension. A self induced fiction. Escaping was my mission. Meditation pitched in. 
                What my body is feeling what my mind may mention.What is my surrounding conditions. All portals to worlds visted by my attention. It can be fatal if not used with skillfull intention.
                Cause things not worthy of my attention slow inch in. Thoughts becoem self inflicted weapons of past recollections. So i focus on my breath sounds
                or the weights that im repping. Moving through the portals of perception my attention steppin. Could be my worst enemy or my secret weapon all depends on how i use my perception.</div>

            <div class="answer">Everythings connected Seperation is a joke. Puts into perspective time wasted living old. Thoughts like water perception as it flows
                Letting go of despiration good riddance to my woes. Focus on my breath when my minds racing loosing hope. If perception is my weapon meditation is the scope.

            <div class="question">Visualization Poem</div>
            <div class="answer">Dreamy Thoughts Flow out my head as if i layed down for bed. But its not words that was said. Its images instead. Perception has my portals, Meditation has my scopes, and inside images come to suface with my focus or they float. Call it image streaming like a pond how it flows. Decided to take control over this boat. Step out of the persepctive meditation is the scope. Now im steering the ship to ride the images that flow. So many perspectives to be then i switch back to me. 
                A new world in 3D housed in my mind. That i now move through all the time. When a problem arise think what can i visualize. See the ablity grow Images don't come as slow. Increase the speed of the flow. Cooperation bewteen portals and the scope. My Brain controls the show. Now you make ask how  let me tell you why an opperation called 3DüëÅMIND</div>
